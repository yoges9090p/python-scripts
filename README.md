# python-scripts
Automating the boring stuff using python
So i created this file to make my work easy. I often have to send attachments to my mobile from my computer and then download them to a folder.
i run this script in my mobile and it automatically downloads the attachment and also it deletes the mail so that i can free up my gmail storage.
